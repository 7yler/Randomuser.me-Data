Randomuser.me Data
==================
Help us make Random User Generator (RUG) better by contributing to our data!

As of now, RUG only has data pertaining to the US and GB.
Now that the backend can handle multiple nationalities, we need help populating it with different data.

That's where you come in!

If you would like to help contribute data specific to a region, please keep these few rules in mind:

1. Please keep all of the data organized.
    - Keep US data in the US directory, AU in the AU directory, etc.
    - Keep filenames consistent across different regions.
2. Please re-sort a list if you modify it. (If you aren't able to sort the list, commit it with a note that it is unsorted and we will fix it for you.)
3. No duplicates. Make sure that the data you are adding isn't already on the list.
    - An easy way to remove duplicates from your file and sort: 
```sh
sort -u <file> -o <file>
```

You may also add new regions if you wish by making a new directory with the appropriate 2 letter ISO Country Code (http://countrycode.org)

And that's about it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask us on our Twitter page @randomapi or send us an email: support@randomapi.com
